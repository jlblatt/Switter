Switter is a simple interface to Twitter's Search API.  Hashtag and user searches are both supported, and results are parsed to support chaining search results.  Switter was designed with graceful degradation as a priority, and should work in all browsers, with or without javascript enabled.

#### Update 1/14/2015

Twitter's v1.0 API has been deprecated for a while now so this project won't work until I find the time to migrate to 1.1.
